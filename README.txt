Just a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios
(although it'd definitely work for other stuff too). Includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.
=======
And here's a new one: Striped, which features a clean, minimalistic design, styling for
all basic page elements (including blockquotes, tables and lists), a repositionable
sidebar (left or right), and HTML5/CSS3 code designed for quick and easy customization
(see code comments for details).

PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
